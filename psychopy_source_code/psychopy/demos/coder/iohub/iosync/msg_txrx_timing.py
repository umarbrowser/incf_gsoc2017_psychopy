"""
This demo requires that an ioSync device is correctly connected to the computer
running this script.

Script can be used to test the round trip time from when an ioSync message
request is sent to when to when the ioSync reply is received. In this test
the 'GET_TIME' request type is sent, which causes ioSync to return the
current ioSync MCU 48 bit usec time.

Each test iteration does the following(in sudo code):

    request = iosync.requestTime()

    reply_id = None
    while reply_id is None:
        reply = iosync.getReplies()
        if reply.id == request.id:
            reply_id = reply.id
            tx_time = request.tx_time
            rx_time = response.rx_time
            round_trip_delay = rx_time - tx_time

    sleep(0.00075) # sleep 750 usec before running next iteration

When the data has been collected, a plot is displayed with the results.
