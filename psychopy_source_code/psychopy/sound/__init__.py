"""Load and play sounds

By default PsychoPy will try to use the following Libs, in this order, for
sound reproduction but you can alter the order in
preferences > general > audioLib:
    ['sounddevice', 'pygame', 'pyo']
For portaudio-based backends (all except for pygame) there is also a
choice of the underlying sound driver (e.g. ASIO, CoreAudio etc).

After importing sound, the sound lib and driver being used will be stored as::
    `psychopy.sound.audioLib`
    `psychopy.sound.audioDriver`

For control of bitrate and buffer size you can call psychopy.sound.init before
creating your first Sound object::

    from psychopy import sound
    sound.init(rate=44100, stereo=True, buffer=128)
    s1 = sound.Sound('ding.wav')

The history of sound libs in PsychoPy:

    - we started with pygame but latencies were always poor
    - we switched to pyo and latencies were better but very system-dependent.
      The problem with pyo is that it has to be compiled which was always
      more painful and prevents us from modifying it easily when needed. It
      also doesn't support python3 as of 2016 and it doesn't support pip for
      installation (e.g. in Anaconda)
    - pysoundcard and sounddevice are new pure python portaudio libraries
      They both install trivially with pip and support python3
      Sounddevice appears to be under most recent development (and shares a
      lot of the original pysoundcard code). In testing we've found the
      latencies to be low

As of PsychoPy 1.85 **sounddevice looks like it will be the best option** but
while it is new there may be some teething problems! To be fair, when writing
the sounddevice code we also changed the method of starting sounds (and pyo
also supports the new method). It is likely that pyo can achieve the same
low latencies as sounddevice, but the other advantages of sounddevice make it
preferable.
