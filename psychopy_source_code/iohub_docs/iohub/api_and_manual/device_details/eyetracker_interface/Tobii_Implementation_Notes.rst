Tobii EyeTracker Class
#######################

**Platforms:** 

* Windows (tested)
* Linux (not tested yet, but should be possible given Tobii python package is available for Linux)
    
**Supported Models:**

* Tobii X120
* Tobii X60 
* Tobii T120
* Tobii T60
* Tobii T60 XL
* Tobii TX300
* Tobii IS-1
* Tobii EyeX (Windows only)
    
.. note::    
    The Common Eye Tracker Interface for Tobii can be used with Python 2.6 if the Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 RC 1 32 bit package. To use Python 2.7, the 
    Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 (released May, 2013) 32-bit version must be installed and used.

Installing Other Necessary Tobii Software
##################################################

**EyeX:**

The Tobii EyeX interface only requires that the Tobii EyeX Windows
drivers are installed, including the Gaze API driver: TobiiGazeCore32.dll.
The iohub class will look in the standard Windows program files locations
for these files. If you have installed the Tobii drivers to a standard 
location, this should work normally.

The EyeX drivers are still in early development. If you experience crashes,
you likely have a newer or older API version than this class was designed to
support. It is tested against TobiiGazeCore32 version 4.0.3.634 currently.

**Other Models:**

The ioHub Common Eye Tracker Interface implementation for Tobii uses the Python 2.6
package that is provided by Tobii as part of their 32-bit Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 RC 1 package; 
or the  Python 2.7 package that is provided by Tobii as part of their 32-bit Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0
(released May, 2013).

Please ensure that the following files and folder are in your Python Path and system PATH.
This is often most easily done by copying these file and folder to your Python 2.6
site-packages folder, located at something like C:\Python26\Lib\site-packages.

Python 2.6 Support
==================

Required files / folder from the Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 RC 1 package for use with Python 2.6:

    *  The directory named 'tobii' found in the Python files area of the 32-bit Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 RC 1 package.
    *  tobiisdk.dll
    *  _tobiisdkpy26.pyd
    *  boost_python-vc90-mt-1_41.dll

Again, the one directory and 3 files listed above must be in a directory in your
Python 2.6 Python Path, as well as in your system PATH environment variable setting.
You do not need to change your system environment variables if you place these
four items in your Python 2.6 site-packages directory.

Python 2.7 Support
==================

Required files / folder from the Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 package for use with Python 2.7:

    *  The directory named 'tobii' found in the Python27\Modules files area of the 32-bit Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0.
    *  tetio.dll
    *  _tetiopy27.pyd
    *  tetio_boost_python-vc90-mt-1_51.dll
    *  tetio_boost_python-vc90-mt-gd-1_51.dll

Again, the one directory and 4 files listed above must be in a directory in your
Python 2.7 Python Path, as well as in your system PATH environment variable setting.
You do not need to change your system environment variables if you place these
five items in your Python 2.7 site-packages directory.

Supported EyeTracker Device Event Types
########################################

The Tobii Analytics SDK 3.0 RC 1 provides real-time access to binocular sample data.
Therefore the BinocularEyeSample event type is supported when using a Tobii as 
the ioHub EyeTracker device. The following fields of the BinocularEyeSample event are 
supported:

    #. psychopy.iohub.devices.eyetracker.BinocularEyeSampleEvent:
        #. Attributes supported:
            #. experiment_id
            #. session_id
            #. event_id
            #. event_type
            #. logged_time
            #. device_time
            #. time
            #. delay
            #. confidence_interval
            #. left_gaze_x:             maps to Tobii eye sample field LeftGazePoint2D.x
            #. left_gaze_y:             maps to LeftGazePoint2D.y
            #. left_eye_cam_x:          maps to LeftEyePosition3DRelative.x
            #. left_eye_cam_y:          maps to LeftEyePosition3DRelative.y
            #. left_eye_cam_z:          maps to LeftEyePosition3DRelative.z
            #. left_pupil_measure_1:    maps to LeftPupil (not available on EyeX)
            #. left_pupil_measure1_type: PUPIL_DIAMETER_MM (not available on EyeX)
            #. right_gaze_x:            maps to Tobii eye sample field RightGazePoint2D.x
            #. right_gaze_y:            maps to RightGazePoint2D.y
            #. right_eye_cam_x:         maps to RightEyePosition3DRelative.x
            #. right_eye_cam_y:         maps to RightEyePosition3DRelative.y
            #. right_eye_cam_z:         maps to RightEyePosition3DRelative.z
            #. right_pupil_measure_1:   maps to RightPupil (not available on EyeX)
            #. right_pupil_measure1_type: PUPIL_DIAMETER_MM (not available on EyeX)
            #. status:                  both left and right eye validity codes are encoded as LeftValidity*10+RightValidity (not available on EyeX)

General Considerations

**Last Updated:** January 29th, 2015

Known Issues:              
==============

None at this time.

Limitations:
==============

N/A

To Do / Wish List:
===================

    #. Add 'tracking status' graphics display.
    #. Show calibration results graphics after calibration.    
    #. Offer calibration graphics mode that is more "Tobii like".
