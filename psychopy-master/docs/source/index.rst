PsychoPy is an open-source application allowing you run a wide range of neuroscience, psychology and psychophysics experiments. It's a free, powerful alternative to Presentation |TM| or e-Prime |TM|, written in Python (a free alternative to Matlab |TM| ).

PsychoPy is unique in giving you a choice of interface: use the **Builder interface** to build rich, flexible experiments easily or use the **Coder interface** to write extremely powerful experiments in the widely-used Python programming language. The best of both worlds!

News
====================

**Workshops**: Time is running out to book onto our **three** :ref:`officialWorkshops` :
 - 26-28 Apr 2017: :ref:`PEP1` to get skills in programming, rather than running experiments *per se*

 - 3-5 May 2017: :ref:`BEP` to get up and running fast with building flexible experiments **including a session on running ONLINE PsychoPy studies**

 - 12-14 July 2017: :ref:`PEP2` to write better Python code: more reusable, better timed, just better!

**Latest version**: 1.85.0 was released Feb 2017 with initial proof-of-concept of online experiments. Beware - these are bound to be buggy so only use if you know what you're doing. And :ref:`READ THE DOCS <online>`. See the full :doc:`changelog`
