For simple changes, and for users that aren't so confident with things like version control systems then just send your changes to [the mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/psychopy-users).

If you want to make more substantial changes then it's often good to discuss them first on the [developers mailing list](http://groups.google.com/group/psychopy-dev). 

The ideal model, is to contribute via the repository on github. There is more information on that in the [developers](https://github.com/psychopy/psychopy/blob/master/docs/source/developers/developers.rst) section of the documentation.
